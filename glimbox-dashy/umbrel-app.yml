description: >-
  Jellyseer is a request management and media discovery tool. It is a fork of Overseerr built to bring support for Jellyfin & Emby media servers.


  Jellyseerr scans your Jellyfin, Emby or Plex libraries at regular intervals, so it knows which items are already available on your server.
  It also integrates with the popular DVR applications Radarr and Sonarr, and supports activity monitoring within Jellyseerr itself.
