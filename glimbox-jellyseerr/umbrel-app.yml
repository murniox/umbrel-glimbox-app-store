  Launches - but for some reason login with jellyfin is not working.

  Jellyseer is a request management and media discovery tool. It is a fork of Overseerr built to bring support for Jellyfin & Emby media servers.


  Jellyseerr scans your Jellyfin, Emby or Plex libraries at regular intervals, so it knows which items are already available on your server.
  It also integrates with the popular DVR applications Radarr and Sonarr, and supports activity monitoring within Jellyseerr itself.


  üõ†Ô∏è SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS

  During initial set-up, you will need to input your Umbrel device's IP address to connect to Jellyfin, Emby or Plex.

  The email address you give does not matter and does not need to exist.

  To connect to Radarr and Sonarr use `http://radarr_server_1` and `http://sonarr_server_1`.
