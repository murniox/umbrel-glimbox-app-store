description: >-
  Sabnzbd is a program to download binary files from Usenet servers.
  Many people upload all sorts of interesting material to Usenet and you need a special program to get this material with the least effort.
  Integrate it into Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr and Prowlarr. 
  You also need a Usenet provider (EWEKA) and an NZB indexer (NZBgeek).
